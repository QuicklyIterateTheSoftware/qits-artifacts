/**
 * The {@code ci-screenshots} category's <b>browser</b> story: finding one captured image without
 * knowing its id.
 *
 * <p>The CI types are the only ones in this explorer whose listing is a <b>time</b> question rather
 * than a name question. A screenshot has no name — its identity is its digest and its meaning is in
 * its metadata — so the repository page renders a filter form (created/accessed windows, a size
 * range, an access state) instead of the search box every named type gets. That is what this story
 * exercises: an operator who knows roughly when a run happened and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The row's link text is the <b>short</b> digest the table prints, not the full id — the first
 * nineteen characters of a bare sha256 hex, which is what {@code shortDigest} in the client's
 * formatting module produces for an id with no {@code sha256:} prefix. Waiting on the full id would
 * wait forever against a table that never prints one.
