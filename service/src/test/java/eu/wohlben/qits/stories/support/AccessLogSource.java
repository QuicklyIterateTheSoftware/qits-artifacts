/**
 * The <b>incoming</b> tap for the command-line stories: the launched process' own access log, read
 * back as {@link NetworkCapture} edges.
 *
 * <p>A RestAssured filter cannot serve these stories the way it serves {@code
 * TokenValidationBootstrapIT}. The subject here is a <b>real external tool</b> — {@code npm
 * publish}, {@code mvn deploy-file}, {@code skopeo copy}, {@code curl} — talking to the packaged
 * process over a socket this JVM never touches. Nothing in the test process is on that path, so the
 * only place the traffic exists is the server's own record of it. {@code
 * quarkus.http.access-log.*} is that record; {@link #configOverrides()} is the whole configuration
 * and {@code PackagedProcessIT.TargetDirState} is the one profile that installs it.
 *
 * <h2>The pattern, and what each token actually yields</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code %m %U %s} — method, requested URL, response status. <b>{@code %U} is {@code
 * HttpServerRequest.uri()}</b>, so it carries the query string as well as the path; that is
 * deliberate rather than tolerated, because two of these stories are <i>about</i> a query (the CI
 * media plane's {@code ?meta.…&latest} golden lookup) and a path-only token would erase the thing
 * they document. {@code %R} is the path-only spelling if that ever has to change.
 *
 * <h2>Attribution: one CLI actor per story</h2>
 *
 * <p>A cumulative source is read <b>lazily, at story end</b>, and the framework's per-source cursor
 * hands each recorded line to exactly one story. Both the actor and the kind are therefore read at
 * <i>drain</i> time, which means a story gets <b>one</b> initiator and <b>one</b> kind for every
 * line it drains. Every story here is one tool doing one job, so that is exactly right — but it is
 * a real limitation and a story that ever drives two different tools would need the edges telling
 * apart another way.
 *
 * <p>{@link #attribute} is what a story calls, once, before its first request. It sets both halves
 * together on purpose: {@link NetworkCapture} resets the actor at every story border but nothing
 * can reset a kind this class invented, so a story that set only the actor would silently inherit
 * the previous story's kind. One call cannot drift.
 *
 * <h2>The floor</h2>
 *
 * <p>The log file is append-only across the whole IT phase — one launched process serves {@code
 * PackagedProcessIT} and all twenty-one stories — and it survives between builds. So the source
 * registers a <b>floor</b> the first time a story attributes anything: every line already in the
 * file at that moment belongs to an earlier build or to {@code PackagedProcessIT}, and none of it
 * is any story's traffic. That works because the class order puts {@code PackagedProcessIT} ahead
 * of every story class ({@code UserflowClassOrderer} breaks ties by class name, and {@code
 * eu.wohlben.qits.PackagedProcessIT} sorts before {@code eu.wohlben.qits.stories.…}). <b>A new
 * non-story IT under this profile whose name sorts after {@code stories} would land its traffic in
 * the first story's diagram</b> — that is the one thing to re-check here.
 *
 * <p>Probes are skipped, as in every tap: this service's non-application root is {@code
 * /artifacts/q}, so the check is on the {@code /q/} <b>segment</b> and a diagram in which every
 * node hangs off {@code /q/health/ready} never happens.
