/**
 * The consuming half of the screenshots chain: what a diff loop does before it compares anything.
 *
 * <p>The interesting part is the query, not the download. A golden image is identified by a
 * <b>pair</b> — the branch it was produced from and the flow it records — and the store answers
 * that pair directly: exact-match {@code meta.<key>=<value>} predicates, plus {@code latest}, which
 * collapses the result to the newest record per {@code (git.branch.name, qits.userflow.name)}
 * group. That is the whole reason this type keeps its metadata in a queryable map instead of in a
 * file name: "the golden for main's login flow" is a question, not a naming convention somebody has
 * to maintain.
 *
 * <p>Both requests are read as an <b>operator</b>, not as the machine that published. The CI media
 * plane splits its roles: the upload is {@code qits:system} and every read — the query and the blob
 * itself — is {@code qits:admin}. A diff loop reading with its publish identity gets a 403, which
 * is a fact worth having a story say out loud.
 *
 * <p>Like its producer, this documents a wire <b>no consumer exists for yet</b>; the loop it
 * describes has never run.
