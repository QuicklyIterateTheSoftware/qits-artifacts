/**
 * The npm category's <b>browser</b> story: headless Chromium over the explorer SPA, against the
 * same packaged process the two command-line stories drove.
 *
 * <p>The web UI is <b>embedded</b> — Quinoa builds {@code src/main/webui} into the artifact and the
 * process serves it at {@code /} — so this flow runs through the service itself and there is no
 * separate frontend to point a browser at. It is also the only place the UI can be seen at all:
 * Quinoa is disabled under {@code @QuarkusTest}, so a unit test asserting anything about {@code /}
 * would pass against a process with no client in it.
 *
 * <p>A <b>mixed</b> story: the {@link Interactions} half narrates, the {@link Flow} half drives the
 * browser, and both land in one interleaved step log with screenshots and a video under {@code
 * target/userstories/}. It browses the package the chain already published rather than publishing
 * one of its own, which is what makes it the chain's last link instead of a third producer.
