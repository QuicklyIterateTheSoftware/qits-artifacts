/**
 * The daemon-binaries wire, at {@code /artifacts/daemons/<name>/<version>}.
 *
 * <p>Two verbs and one idea: a streaming {@code PUT} that publishes, and a streaming {@code GET}
 * that serves. The maven wire's shape with the derivations taken out, because a daemon binary has
 * none — it is one file with one coordinate.
 *
 * <p><b>The row write IS the publish.</b> One request stages the bytes, promotes them into the blob
 * store and inserts the {@code daemon_binary} row, so there is no way to store a daemon's bytes
 * without an identity. That is the hole this type was created to close: the bootstrap's monolithic
 * {@code POST} to the OCI blob-upload session promoted bytes and wrote no row by construction, which
 * is why every row-less byte in this store is a ci-daemon build. Re-publishing an existing version
 * is {@code 409} — versions are immutable, latest-wins never happens, and the response carries the
 * computed digest, which is what a release pipeline pastes into a deployment.
 *
 * <p><b>Two spellings of download, deliberately</b> (daemon-artifact-identity-plan.md §2.2). The
 * digest-addressed blob route on {@code /v2} is <em>untouched</em>: the launcher, the URL template
 * and every existing pin keep working exactly as they are, and the digest stays what {@code
 * qits.ci.daemon-version} holds (⚖2). The version-addressed {@code GET} here is the readable second
 * spelling, safe to add only because a version pointer never moves.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no authentication here, at all</b> — the same stance {@code /v2}, {@code
 * /artifacts/npm} and {@code /artifacts/maven} take, and for the same reason: on qits-net producers
 * are trusted, and a publish surface that needed a credential store would need one before the
 * platform can build anything. What a publish cannot do is <em>change</em> anything — a version is
 * immutable ({@code 409} on republish) and a consumer pins the digest this route echoes, so
 * integrity comes from addressing rather than from write auth. Machine auth arrives wholesale with
 * qits-idp, for every surface at once; gating this one alone would report a decision nobody took.
 *
 * <p>Reads are anonymous for the extra reason that the cold-start path is a bootstrap script with no
 * token: a fresh platform has to be able to fetch a daemon before it has any CI to mint a credential
 * with.
 *
 * <p><b>No {@code BodyHandler}, anywhere in this class.</b> {@code BodyHandler.create()} defaults to
 * 10 MiB and the binary is 43 MB, so one would have silently 413'd every real publish — the git
 * host's {@code max-pack-size} lesson. The {@code PUT} streams through {@code OciRequestBody}
 * instead, bounded by {@code qits.artifacts.daemon.max-binary-size}, which is also the only bound a
 * chunked upload has: the global {@code quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size} gates a declared
 * {@code Content-Length} only.

   * raised in a deployment the day a release lands is a cap that will be raised in a hurry. It is a
   * config knob and not a constant for the reason the other three are — it has to be able to move
