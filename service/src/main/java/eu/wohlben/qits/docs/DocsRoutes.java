/**
 * The docs wire, at {@code /artifacts/docs/<repository>/<site>/-/<version>[/<path>]}.
 *
 * <p>Two verbs and one idea, the daemon wire's shape with a bundle where it has a file: a streaming
 * {@code PUT} that publishes a whole version, and a {@code GET} that serves one file of one version
 * straight out of the blob store.
 *
 * <p><b>The publish is atomic across fifty-odd files.</b> Every entry is staged and promoted before
 * a single row is written, and then {@code DocsRegistryService.publish} writes the site and all of
 * its files in one transaction — so a version is either wholly published or not published at all.
 * That matters more here than for any single-file type: a half-written site is one that lists itself
 * and then 404s its own stylesheet, which looks like a broken deployment rather than a failed
 * publish. Re-publishing a version is {@code 409}; versions are immutable, which is what lets
 * qits-docs resolve {@code latest} by query and hold no state of its own.
 *
 * <p><b>This service is the byte plane, not the website.</b> There is no index-file convention here,
 * no redirect and no notion of {@code latest}: {@code GET …/-/<version>} answers JSON metadata, and
 * asking for {@code index.html} means asking for {@code index.html}. Every one of those is a reading
 * experience, they belong to qits-docs, and putting them here would mean two services with an
 * opinion about what a documentation URL means.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no authentication here, at all</b> — the same stance {@code /v2}, {@code
 * /artifacts/npm}, {@code /artifacts/maven} and {@code /artifacts/daemons} take, and for the same
 * reason: on qits-net producers are trusted, and what a publish cannot do is <em>change</em>
 * anything, because a version is immutable. Machine auth arrives wholesale with qits-platform-idp,
 * for every surface at once; gating this one alone would report a decision nobody took.
 *
 * <p><b>No {@code BodyHandler}, anywhere in this class.</b> {@code BodyHandler.create()} defaults to
 * 10 MiB — the measured Storybook bundle is 9.7 MB uncompressed and the next one will not be, so it
 * would 413 real publishes on a threshold nobody chose. The {@code PUT} streams through {@code
 * OciRequestBody} into a scratch blob instead. Note what bounds it: {@code
 * qits.artifacts.docs.max-bundle-size} is checked against the <b>uncompressed</b> total inside
 * {@link DocsBundle}, because a compressed archive makes {@code Content-Length} a measure of the
 * wrong number.
