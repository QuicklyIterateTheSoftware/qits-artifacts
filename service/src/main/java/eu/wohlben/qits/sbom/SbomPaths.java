/**
 * The route grammar for {@code /artifacts/sboms}.
 *
 * <p>One regex per route with named {@code (?<name>…)} groups, the {@code RegistryPaths}/{@code
 * NpmPaths}/{@code MavenPaths}/{@code DaemonPaths}/{@code DocsPaths} pattern.
 *
 * <p><b>Every group here is either {@code (?<name>…)} or {@code (?:…)}, never a bare {@code (…)}.</b>
 * vertx-web compares {@code Matcher.groupCount()} against the named groups it scraped out of the
 * pattern and silently falls back to positional {@code param0…paramN} when the two disagree — so one
 * stray capturing group breaks every {@code pathParam(…)} on that route, at runtime, with no error
 * anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Matching runs against {@code normalizedPath()}, which collapses dot-segments before routing —
 * so {@code ..} never reaches a handler.
 *
 * <p><b>The path spells the {@code SoftwareRelease} identity and nothing else</b> — {@code
 * <packageType>/<packageName>/-/<version>}. There is no repository segment: the {@code sboms} row is
 * seeded and there is exactly one of it, so a segment naming it would be a constant the publisher
 * has to know and get right.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code /-/} is what separates a multi-segment name from its version</b>, npm's separator
 * rather than a new invention, and it is here for the same reason it is in {@code DocsPaths}: a
 * package name is variable depth — {@code qits/qits-artifacts} for docker, {@code
 * @qits/ui-components} for npm — so {@code <name>/<version>} is ambiguous without a marker.
 *
 * <p><b>The ambiguity is closed by the segment shape, not by ordering the routes.</b> A {@link
 * #SEGMENT} must begin with {@code @} or an alphanumeric, so a bare {@code -} is not a name segment
 * and {@code @qits/ui-components/-/1.0.0} cannot be read as a four-segment name however hard the
 * matcher tries. That is what lets {@link #PACKAGE} and {@link #DOCUMENT} coexist without either
 * shadowing the other, and it is the kind of property that stays true until someone loosens a
 * character class — so {@code SbomPathsTest} pins it.
 *
 * <p><b>A segment admits {@code :}, which {@code DocsPaths}' does not, and that is the one real
 * difference between the two grammars.</b> A maven {@code packageName} carries groupId AND
 * artifactId in a single value — {@code eu.wohlben.qits:qits-eventstream} — because that is how
 * {@code SoftwareRelease} travels it, and re-spelling it as two path segments here would make this
 * wire the one place the identity is written differently. The colon sits <em>inside</em> one
 * segment; it never separates two.
 *
 * <p>The package type is matched loosely on purpose — see {@link #PACKAGE_TYPE}.
