/**
 * The SBOM wire, at {@code /artifacts/sboms/<packageType>/<packageName>/-/<version>}.
 *
 * <p>Two verbs and one idea, the daemon wire's shape with a document where it has a binary: a
 * streaming {@code PUT} that publishes one CycloneDX document, and a {@code GET} that serves it back
 * byte for byte out of the blob store.
 *
 * <p><b>The path IS the {@code SoftwareRelease} identity.</b> {@code (packageType, packageName,
 * version)} is spelled exactly as qits-ci announces it, so a consumer of that event fetches the
 * document with no translation step — which is the whole reason one shared attachment surface exists
 * instead of a metadata slot on each of four wires that could not carry one.
 *
 * <p><b>First-write-wins, and that differs from the daemon 409 on purpose.</b> A daemon re-publish
 * means a release ran twice and is worth failing loudly; this {@code PUT} sits <em>inside</em> that
 * same release run, one step after the artifact publish, and release steps are retried and replayed
 * as a matter of course. A 409 here would turn every replay of a green release into a red one over a
 * document already exactly where it belongs, so a re-PUT answers {@code 200} describing the row that
 * stands, with {@code alreadyPublished: true}. The property that matters is not "published once" but
 * <b>immutability</b> — the stored document can never <em>change</em> — and that holds either way.
 * It is also what keeps this surface safe to leave tokenless.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no authentication here, at all</b> — the stance {@code /v2}, {@code
 * /artifacts/npm}, {@code /artifacts/maven}, {@code /artifacts/daemons} and {@code /artifacts/docs}
 * all take, and for the same reason: on qits-net producers are trusted, and a publish surface that
 * needed a credential store would need one before the platform can build anything. What a publish
 * cannot do is change anything, and a consumer verifies the document against the digest this route
 * echoes, so integrity comes from addressing rather than from write auth. Machine auth arrives
 * wholesale with qits-platform-idp, for every surface at once; gating this one alone would report a
 * decision nobody took.
 *
 * <p><b>No {@code BodyHandler}, anywhere in this class.</b> {@code BodyHandler.create()} defaults to
 * 10 MiB with nothing in the log to say so — the trap the daemon publish would have fallen into. The
 * {@code PUT} streams through {@code OciRequestBody} into a bounded in-memory buffer instead, capped
 * by {@code qits.artifacts.sbom.max-size}.
