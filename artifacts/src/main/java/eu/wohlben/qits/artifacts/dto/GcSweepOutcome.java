 * The blob half of a sweep receipt: files actually unlinked, and every candidate that was not.

 * @param blobsUnlinked how many files were unlinked
 * @param bytesReclaimed what they occupied on disk — the only figure in this feature that is disk
 *     coming back
 * @param withheldByGraceWindow candidates whose file is younger than the grace window. They are not
 *     lost, only not yet: their identity rows were withheld with them, and the next run past the
 *     window takes rows and files together.
 * @param withheldBytes what the withheld candidates occupy
 * @param stillReferenced candidates something still named at unlink time — a withheld identity of
 *     another type, or a store that moved between plan and unlink. Refused, which is the mechanism
 *     working.
 * @param alreadyGone candidates with no file left to unlink
 * @param unlinkedBlobIds every digest that was unlinked, in full and sorted — a receipt exists to
 *     be checked against the store by hand, and a count cannot be
