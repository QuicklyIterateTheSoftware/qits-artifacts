/**
 * What one repository type's strategy actually deleted in a sweep, and what it declined to.
 *
 * @param type the repository type, in its wire spelling
 * @param strategy the strategy's class name, or null when none is registered
 * @param note the strategy's standing caption (the CI stubs name their intended rule here), or the
 *     "no strategy registered" line for an unclaimed type. Null when there is nothing to say.
 * @param error the strategy refused to plan (fail-closed — nothing of this type was touched), or
 *     one or more identities could not be applied, each named with its reason. Null when clean.
 * @param deleted the identities whose rows are gone now, each still naming the rule that condemned
 *     it — the receipt half of the dry-run's {@code dead} list
 * @param withheldByGraceWindow identities left whole because a blob they release is still inside
 *     the grace window. Deleting the row first would strand the blob — row-less blobs are
 *     untouchable by construction — so row and file wait out the window together and the next run
 *     takes both.
