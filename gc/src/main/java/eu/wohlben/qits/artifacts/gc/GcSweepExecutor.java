/**
 * The executed sweep: what the dry-run reports, done — plan, delete the identity rows, unlink the
 * blobs, and hand back the receipt.
 *
 * <p>One run is one request, and that is a safety property rather than a convenience: every plan
 * this class applies was computed <b>in this run</b>, from a census taken at its start — the OCI
 * strategy's cd pins included, fetched inside its {@code plan()} moments before the rows go. There
 * is deliberately no way to hand this class a plan: a stored plan is a plan on stale facts, and a
 * plan on stale facts deletes a running image.
 *
 * <p>The dry-run's honesty rules carry over whole. Every type is in the receipt; a strategy that
 * refuses to plan fails closed with its type untouched and its reason on the wire; two claimants
 * are a collision and neither runs; the row-less pool is restated on every receipt. What the
 * receipt adds is the withheld column: <b>the grace window gates identity rows here, not only blob
 * unlinks</b>, because a row deleted while its blob's file is inside the window would strand the
 * blob — row-less, therefore untouchable, therefore never reclaimed. A withheld identity is left
 * whole and re-planned by the next run; row and file mature out of the window together. The
 * expected first receipt on a young store is therefore zeros everywhere, and that no-op is the
 * proof the mechanism is safe.
 *
 * <p>Every run logs one line per type and one for the blob loop, so "what did GC ever do" stays a
 * question with an answer.
