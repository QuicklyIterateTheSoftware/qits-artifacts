/**
 * The second and last outbound call this service makes: {@code GET /ci/api/daemon}, at plan time,
 * every time.
 *
 * <p>Everything {@link CdHttpDeploymentPins}' javadoc says about the direction, the caching and the
 * failure posture holds here verbatim, with one difference that is the whole reason this class needs
 * its own paragraph: <b>a blank version is a successful answer</b>. qits-ci reporting
 * {@code {"daemonVersion":"","source":"none"}} means this deployment has pinned no daemon, which is
 * the shipped default. Turning that into a failure would abort every run on a platform that has
 * published no daemon yet — a collector that never runs is not a safe collector, it is a broken one.
 *
 * <p>What does abort a run is qits-ci being unreachable, answering non-200, or answering a shape
 * this cannot read. Then {@link GcPinSources} records the failure and nothing is deleted.
 *
 * <p>The {@code HttpClient} is an <b>instance</b> field for the native-image reason the other three
 * outbound clients in this repository carry; the rule travels with the client.
