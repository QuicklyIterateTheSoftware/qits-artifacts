/**
 * One repository type's garbage collection: which of <b>its</b> identities are dead, and which blobs
 * that changes.
 *
 * <p>The seam exists so the substrate can stay policy-free, and it is drawn where it is for one
 * reason: an identity — a tag, a version, a record row — has a meaning only inside its type, while a
 * blob has none anywhere. So a strategy answers only about identities and the blobs they name, and
 * <b>never</b> decides that a blob may be unlinked. Which blobs lost their last reference across all
 * types is {@link BlobSweep}'s answer, and only its answer.
 *
 * <p><b>One strategy per type, and the rule inside it is an engine's.</b> This used to read "sharing
 * no policy code", on the argument that docker's and npm's rules only look alike by coincidence.
 * The user's settlement of 2026-08-05 ({@code artifacts-gc-plan.md}) overturned that: the rule is an
 * engine's — {@link OwnArtifactsStrategy} here, and the cache-eviction engine in
 * qits-platform-mirror, which is where the types it collects went — and configuration says which
 * type runs which. So an implementation of this interface is a <b>binder</b>: it names its
 * type and its {@link GcTypeAdapter}, and carries no rule of its own. What survives the settlement
 * is the count: exactly one strategy may claim a type, and two claimants are a collision the
 * planner reports rather than a merge it performs. Registering one is a CDI bean of this type and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * <p><b>Failing is a supported answer, and it is fail-closed.</b> A strategy that cannot establish
 * its keep-set must throw rather than plan without it. The planner catches it, reports the type as
 * failed, and treats every blob the census attributes to that type as live, so a broken dependency
 * reclaims nothing instead of reclaiming something it cannot vouch for.
 *
 * <p><b>Live pins arrive as an argument, fetched once per run.</b> A strategy does not dial another
 * service itself: {@code GcPinSources} reads qits-platform-deployments and qits-ci at the start of every plan and
 * every sweep, and {@link #plan} is handed the result. Two fetches inside one run can disagree, and
 * a strategy holding its own source is how that happens. A strategy whose keep-set depends on those
 * pins says so with {@link #readsPins()}, and is not planned at all on a run whose pins are
 * incomplete.
