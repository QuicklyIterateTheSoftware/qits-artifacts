 * What a launching service would pull <b>today</b> — the effective image versions, answered by the

 *
 * <p><b>This is a different tense from {@link ConfigurationImagePins} and neither can stand in for
 * the other.</b> qits-configuration holds the version the <em>next</em> deploy of a launching service
 * will be given; a service keeps launching the version it was deployed with until that deploy
 * happens. So for as long as the gap lasts, the configured answer names an image nobody pulls while
 * the one everybody pulls is named by nothing — and under a P3D window that is a live image kept
 * alive by access alone, which is exactly the inference the short windows gave up on.
 *
 * <p><b>One interface, two ports, and the split is not cosmetic.</b> {@link WorkspacesLaunchPins}
 * and {@link ProjectsLaunchPins} are separate types because they are separate sources: two injection
 * points, two urls, two entries in a run's pins section, and two independent failures. What they
 * share is the document shape, which is why the parse below is shared — one reading of one shape,
 * with the service that answered it named in every refusal.
