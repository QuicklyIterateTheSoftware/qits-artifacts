/**
 * The dry run: every repository type, what its strategy would delete, and what a sweep would then
 * unlink.
 *
 * <p>This is the artifact the user reads before any collection is switched on, so its job is to be
 * <b>honest about absence</b>. Every REGISTERED type appears in every report, including the ones
 * nobody collects: a missing entry would read as "nothing to collect here", and "no strategy
 * registered" is a different fact. "Registered" is the profile beans on the classpath rather than an
 * enum's constants — the cache types are qits-platform-mirror's and are absent here, which is a
 * stronger statement than reporting them uncollected.
 *
 * <p>Strategies are found by CDI type. Adding one to a repository type is a bean implementing {@link
 * GcStrategy}; nothing here is edited, and nothing here knows what a tag or a version is.
 *
 * <p>Two failure shapes are reported rather than thrown, because a report that 500s tells a reviewer
 * nothing about the other four types: a strategy that refuses to plan (fail-closed — its type keeps
 * every blob), and two strategies claiming one type, which is a policy collision and never a merge.
 *
 * <p><b>The report also echoes the configuration</b> ({@link GcRules}): per type, the configured
 * engine, its window and the effective rule as a sentence. The settlement moved the policy into
 * configuration, and configuration is the half of a plan the dead and kept lists cannot show —
 * "nothing died" reads identically whether the rule is right or the window is a year. The echo reads
 * as the rule that actually ran: {@link OwnArtifactsStrategy} writes the sentence and the same class
 * produced the plan beside it.
 *
 * <p><b>Per repository is a reading of the same run, never a second planner.</b> The type loop is
 * the only place a rule is ever applied; a repository's figures are its share of its type's plan
 * ({@link GcStrategy.Plan#scopedTo}) reconciled against the same census. So the listing, the
 * whole-store report and a single repository's detail report cannot disagree — there is one plan
 * underneath all three. The rows come from {@code artifact_repository} rather than from the planned
 * identities, because a repository with nothing to collect must still appear: derived from
 * identities, an empty repository would silently vanish from the list.
