/**
 * The platform's own images, as facts: what a coordinate is, what a release is, which of two
 * releases is newer, what qits-platform-deployments would pull, and how a row goes.
 *
 * <h2>What a release is here</h2>
 *
 * <p>A <b>calver tag</b>. In docker there is no {@code -main.g<sha>} suffix — the sha tag <em>is</em>
 * the prerelease coordinate and a release adds a version tag beside it — so "the last 2 released
 * versions of every image" means exactly "the two newest tags shaped like a calver version". Newer
 * is the version's own order ({@link #BY_CALVER}) rather than a row timestamp, because a release
 * pulled last week is not thereby a newer release than one cut yesterday.
 *
 * <h2>The two belts this type derives itself: the newest RELEASE tag, and {@code latest}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #pinnedBy} keeps every coordinate the five image pin sources name <b>and</b> each
 * image's newest calver tag. The second is a pin in all but name — the pull the <em>next</em> deploy
 * will make — and it is here rather than in cd because cd cannot answer for a deployment that has
 * not happened: {@code qits-spa-home} has tags and not a single deployment row, and without this
 * line the next deploy could pull a tag this run deleted. That is the measured {@code
 * IMAGE_MISSING} hazard, and it is one line.
 *
 * <p>The other is {@link #KEPT_LATEST}: a tag literally named {@code latest} is always kept. It is a
 * pointer rather than a coordinate, no release rule can see it, and the pulls that would keep it warm
 * are the ones a host's keep-prefix suppresses. Its own constant carries the argument.
 *
 * <p><b>It reads the CALVER tag and not the sha tag, and that flip is the whole of 2026-09-04.</b>
 * This belt used to name each image's most recently written <em>build sha</em>, because that is what
 * cd pulled: a deployment was created from {@code qits/<app>:<sha>} and the next one would be
 * created from the newest sha the store held. Deployments are made by VERSION COORDINATE now — cd
 * asks for {@code qits/<app>:<version>}, the calver the release was cut under — so the newest sha
 * is a coordinate nothing will ever pull again, and a belt spent on it protects nothing while
 * telling every reader of the report that it is protecting "the next deployment's pull target". A
 * lie in a keep-rule is worse than a missing belt: it is the line a reviewer trusts when deciding
 * whether a tag may go.
 *
 * <p><b>Newest is {@link #BY_CALVER}, the version's own order, and no timestamp at all.</b> The sha
 * form had no intrinsic order, so the old belt had to read {@code oci_tag.updated_at} and had to
 * argue at length for why it was not reading the access time (a pull of an older sha would have
 * lifted it and disarmed the belt on exactly the cold image it exists for). A calver tag carries its
 * order in its name: the next deploy pulls the highest version, whenever its row happened to be
 * written and whoever last pulled it. The argument disappears with the timestamp, and so does the
 * per-group query the old belt needed — the enumeration in hand already says which candidates are
 * releases.
 *
 * <p><b>The belt overlaps the last-2 retention today, and it is still not the same fact.</b> The
 * newest calver of a group is always among that group's two newest releases, so this rule and {@code
 * OwnArtifactsStrategy}'s keep the same tag — under different names and for different reasons.
 * Retention is archival policy ("keep the last two, whatever their age"); this is an operational
 * fact ("this exact coordinate is what the next deploy will ask the registry for"). Two independent
 * reasons for one keep is what a belt is; and the belt is the one that survives a change to
 * {@code RELEASES_KEPT}, which is a number and not a guarantee.
 *
 * <h2>Whether a released-but-undeployed version can be collected</h2>
 *
 * <p>Audited on 2026-09-04, because cd's pins cover only <em>live</em> deployments and retention
 * covers only the last two releases — so a third-newest version that was released and never deployed
 * is named by neither. It is nevertheless covered, by the rule that was already there: a candidate's
 * effective access time folds creation in ({@link #latest}), and for a tag "creation" is {@code
 * updated_at}, the moment the release pushed it. <b>Every calver tag is therefore kept for a full
 * window from its push, deployed or not</b> — which is the "minimum age before a release is
 * collectable" guard, already load-bearing and arrived at from the other direction.
 *
 * <p>What is left eligible is a version that is all four of: older than the window, unpulled for
 * every day of it, displaced from the last two releases of its image, and named by no deployment cd
 * would restore. That is "a release nobody deployed in a month, superseded twice since" — the
 * settlement's intended collection rather than a hazard, and the same sentence it already applies to
 * an old npm version nobody installs. Nothing was widened; this paragraph is the change.
 *
 * <h2>What is a candidate, and what is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every tag, and every manifest that <b>no tag names and no tagged manifest reaches</b>. The
 * second half is the mirror adapter's rule for the mirror adapter's reason: a tagged manifest's
 * identity is its tag, and a child of a tagged index is reached through that index's closure, so
 * neither is an identity of its own. What is left is the store's measured 73 untagged manifests — a
 * tag re-push moves the tag row to the new manifest and leaves the old row reachable from no
 * coordinate anyone uses — and they now age out on access like anything else.
 *
 * <p>A manifest under a tag this run condemns is therefore collected on the <em>next</em> run, once
 * it is untagged. One run, one class of identity; the alternative is a two-phase rule inside a
 * single plan, which is the shape the engine seam exists to refuse.
 *
 * <p><b>Effective access is {@code max(updated/created, accessed_at)}</b>, from V9's columns. A
 * tag's non-access timestamp is {@code updated_at} — the moment those bytes became this tag's — and
 * creation counting as a first access is what stops a tag pushed ten minutes ago from reading as
 * never-pulled.
 *
 * <p>Deletion runs through the registry's own funnel ({@code OciRegistryCollection}), tags before
 * manifests, exactly as {@code OciMirrorGcAdapter} does it: nothing in that funnel reads a
 * repository's type, so both OCI types have always come through the same door. The code is written
 * out twice rather than shared, which is this module's standing rule — two types may share an
 * engine the user picked for both, and they still own their own facts.
