/**
 * The own-artifacts engine: the belt (last two releases per group), the pin, and the window — in
 * that order, which is the order that makes it safe.
 *
 * <p>Plain JUnit against {@link FakeGcTypeAdapter} for the cache engine's reason: what a release is
 * and which of two is newer are the adapter's answers, so a case driven through a real type would
 * test that type's parsing rather than this engine's counting.
 *
 * <p><b>The window here is P90D and no shipped type carries it any more</b>, which is deliberate:
 * this suite is about the engine's counting, and the engine still behaves exactly this way for
 * whatever window it is handed. What the deployed configuration hands it is {@code P0D} — the
 * realignment of 2026-09-05 — and that has a case of its own below, because zero is where the rule's
 * last branch stops being a window at all.
