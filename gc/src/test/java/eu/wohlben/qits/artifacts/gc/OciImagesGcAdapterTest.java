/**
 * The own engine over docker's facts, case by case, against real manifests and the real census.
 *
 * <p><b>This suite is the port of {@code OciImageGcStrategyTest}, and the cases carry over one for
 * one</b> — calver, cd's pins, the newest-release belt, the untagged manifests, the grace window —
 * with the one change the settlement made: what condemns a coordinate is no longer "a newer build
 * exists" but "nothing has pulled it inside the window". Every case therefore has to say how old its
 * rows are, and the ones that used to prove a structural kill now prove an <em>access-gated</em>
 * one. The direction of that change is a loosening: {@code aShaTagSomethingStillPulls…} is the case
 * that could not have existed before.
 *
 * <p><b>The belt's cases moved from the sha to the calver on 2026-09-04</b>, with the deployments
 * they describe: cd creates a deployment from {@code qits/<app>:<version>} now, so "the next
 * deploy's pull target" is the newest release and a sha tag has no claim on that rule any more.
 * Three cases carry the flip directly — {@code theBeltNamesTheNewestCALVER…}, {@code
 * theBeltReadsTheVersionsOwnOrder…} and {@code anImageThatHasNeverBeenReleasedHasNoBeltAtAll} — and
 * a fourth, {@code aReleasedVersionNothingHasDeployedYetSurvives…}, holds the audit that went with
 * it: a released-but-undeployed version is covered by the access rule's fold of {@code updated_at},
 * not by the pin and not by retention.
 *
 * <p><b>Three pin sources reach this type since 2026-09-04</b>, and they differ by tense: cd names
 * the images of containers that exist, qits-platform-maintenance names the images a repository's
 * Dockerfile still builds {@code FROM}, and qits-configuration names the images a service would
 * launch the next time somebody asks it to. The last two join on the FULL image name, cd on the
 * image half alone, and each has a case of its own below. The fourth belt, {@link
 * OciImagesGcAdapter#KEPT_LATEST}, is structural and reads no pin at all.
 *
 * <p>The pins are handed in as a value rather than fetched: what is under test is the keep-set, and
 * its whole input is "which coordinates does a source pin for this image". Which rows those came from is
 * cd's rule and is tested in cd's own repository. The port's field is still called {@code shas} and
 * its strings are opaque, so cases pin whichever shape they are about.
 *
 * <p>Sha tags are written as full 40-hex strings because that is what per-push CI used to push and
 * what an old deployment row carries; a case using {@code v1} would prove nothing about the
 * classification these facts turn on. Version tags are written as real calvers for the same reason.
