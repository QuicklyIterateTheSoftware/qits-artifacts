/**
 * An in-process stand-in for any of the six pin peers, one path and one canned answer.
 *
 * <p>There is no network in this repository's suite and none of the six peers to dial, so the six
 * HTTP adapters would otherwise only ever be tested on their failure path. What they have to get
 * right is the <b>shape</b> — which key holds the array, which field is blank, what a non-200 means
 * — and that can only be proved against something that answers.
 *
 * <p>Five of the six answer at {@code /pins} and the daemon at {@code /daemon}, so a case that
 * needs two peers at once takes two instances rather than one server with two contexts: each peer
 * gets its own base url, which is what the adapters are configured with anyway. That is doing real
 * work for the two launch readers: they share one parse, so only a distinct base url can show that
 * each reader called its own service.
 *
 * <p>Driven over real HTTP rather than by calling the parser directly, for the reason the npm proxy
 * suite records: an adapter tested past its transport passes just as well when the transport is
 * wrong.
